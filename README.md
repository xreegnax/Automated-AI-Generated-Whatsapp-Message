This project aims to automate responses to WhatsApp messages using OpenAI's GPT-3 API. The program consists of two files, whatsmsg.py which contains the main logic, and whatsapp.py which contains the credentials and function to send WhatsApp messages using the Twilio API. When a user asks a question in the whatsmsg.py program, the question is passed to the ask_question() function which calls the GPT-3 API and gets a response. That response is then sent as a WhatsApp message to the user's number using the send_whatsapp_message() function from whatsapp.py. The user is then prompted if they want to ask another question, and the loop continues. The benefits of the project are that the user simply needs to ask questions in WhatsApp and the program will automatically reply using responses generated from GPT-3. However, the user must have a Twilio number configured to send WhatsApp messages and GPT-3 responses may not always be accurate, requiring human oversight. The project aims to demonstrate how to integrate GPT-3 and Twilio APIs to build an automated WhatsApp helper bot.
